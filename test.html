        <p>
          I am a science fiction writer and Star Trek geek, a teacher, a mother
          of three, a medical science enthusiast and a software developer. I am
          interested in code projects that combine any of my interests. I have
          worked on technical curriculum, mobile applications for health care,
          and games for creating plot outlines in fiction. I also write and
          publish short stories.

          People talk about how wonderful the world seems to children, and
          that's true enough. But children think they will grow into it and
          understand it, and I know very well that I will not, and would not if
          I had a dozen lives.
